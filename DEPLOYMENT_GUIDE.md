# 🚀 Deployment Guide - Fix 404 Errors

## Issue: 404 Errors in Production

You're seeing 404 errors because the production build needs to be rebuilt and redeployed.

---

## ✅ Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Build the Project
```bash
npm run build
```

This creates the `dist` folder with your production files.

### 2. Deploy to Firebase
```bash
firebase deploy
```

Or deploy only hosting:
```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### 3. Clear Browser Cache
After deployment:
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
- Or clear browser cache completely

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### firebase.json Updates
- ✅ Proper SPA routing (rewrites all routes to index.html)
- ✅ Cache headers for static assets
- ✅ Removed unused functions configuration

### Why 404 Errors Happened
1. Old build was deployed
2. Routes weren't properly configured
3. Browser cache had old version

## 🌐 Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in `.env`:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_domain
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_bucket
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
```

**Note:** Vite requires `VITE_` prefix for environment variables!

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still Getting 404 Errors

**Solution 1: Clear Firebase Hosting Cache**
```bash
firebase hosting:disable
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

**Solution 2: Check Build Output**
```bash
# Make sure dist folder exists
ls -la dist

# Should contain:
# - index.html
# - assets/ folder
# - vite.svg or other assets
```

**Solution 3: Verify Firebase Project**
```bash
firebase projects:list
firebase use your-project-id
```

### Issue: Routes Work Locally But Not in Production

This means the build wasn't deployed. Run:
```bash
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### Issue: Environment Variables Not Working

Vite requires `VITE_` prefix:
- ❌ `FIREBASE_API_KEY`
- ✅ `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`

Rebuild after changing .env:
```bash
npm run build
firebase deploy
```

### Issue: Old Version Still Showing

Clear cache:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

Or:
```bash
# Add cache busting to firebase.json (already done)
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## 📱 Testing Deployment

### Test All Routes
```bash
# Your production URL
https://your-project.web.app/

```

### Test Features
1. **Login/Register** - Should work
2. **Dashboard** - Should load
3. **Emergency Button** - Should be visible
4. **AI Chatbot** - Should open
